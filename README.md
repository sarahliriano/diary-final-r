## My Diary App

I decided to make a diary app because I think it was a nice way of bringing together a lot of what we've gone over in class.

The link to the deployed app on Heroku is this one: https://diary-final.herokuapp.com/

This is what I started as my idea. Something simple but pleasant to look like so that it's not too distracting nor too "utilitarian".
