## My Diary App

I decided to make a diary app because I think it was a nice way of bringing together a lot of what we've gone over in class.

The link to the deployed app on Heroku is this one: https://diary-final.herokuapp.com/

This is what I started as my idea. Something simple but pleasant to look like so that it's not too distracting nor too "utilitarian".

I didn't get inspired from outside sources as much this time. Tried to keep it simple. I imagined something that I would want to use. Something simple enough to not be intimidating but still functional and pleasing.

I needed my app to be able to save past entries, be able to post new ones and delete old ones. Ideally you would also be able to edit the entries but in the end I couldn't makeit work. I had a lot of errors on that end that I couldn't resolve like the other ones.

I started by watching and following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NrHkjlWVhM

I got pretty far down several times but kept bumping into an error:

I managed to figure out with help from my friend De'Ane Kennedy, that the problem was that when it got to the point of posting to the database I was hitting an error because this method was using MongoDB in the local computer and not on the cloud like we had been doing in class. I decided to do it the tutorial way and then figure out a way to connect it to my account of MongoDB on the cloud. I went through the process of installing it on my computer, which wasn't a straightforward process because I had to also install homebrew first and follow several steps in order to get it working.

Once that was working most of it was straightforward except the "Edit" function. For some reason the route to my "Edit" view was making my server crash and I couldn't figure out why.

I liked that the tutorial used some bootstrap because it was something slightly more familiar to me from an html css class I took some years back and it makes grids and styling certain things much faster and easier.

Another thing I couldn't make work was the pre-populating the fields with previously entered information.

**Next steps**
- Get the "Edit" function to work.
- Even though I got most of the colors in I would like to get the look as close to my original designs as possible.
